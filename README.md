Introduction:
Economic recessions, defined by significant declines in market activity and output, have far-reaching impacts on global economies and societies. A key symptom and driver of these downturns is a rise in unemployment rates, which affects individuals and sectors across the economic spectrum. This study delves into the complex interplay between major economic indicators including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Federal Funds rate, the S&P500 index, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and their relationship to unemployment rates during recessionary periods. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding these dynamics is more pertinent than ever. This research aims to explore historical trends over the past five decades to discern patterns that could help predict changes in unemployment rates, particularly in the context of the unique economic challenges posed by the pandemicâ€™s aftermath.

Objective:
The core objective of this research is to analyze the interaction between key economic indicators and their predictive power over unemployment rates during times of economic recession in the United States, spanning the last fifty years. The study will examine the Consumer Price Index (CPI), unemployment rates, Federal Funds rate, S&P500 index, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), both individually and collectively, to identify patterns that may signal impending shifts in unemployment. The goal is to determine if these historical trends can be used to forecast future changes in unemployment rates, especially in the post-COVID economic environment.
